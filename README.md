my croquet tracker
<p>The purpose of this application is to assist in the complexities of an aggressive and messy game of croquet in which many users are hitting other balls and generally creating mayhem as part of a strategy of game domination.</p>
<p>The tracker is not a croquet simulator, but rather a tool for tracking who is live on who else, and which hoop is the objective for each player.</p>
<p>It requires someone to actively be recording real-time activities. It is possible for a player to do this task -- and that is the way the tool is generally used -- although having someone whose dedicated task is using the tracker (e.g., a referee) is ideal.</p>
